reviews were on point though not very in depth 9.5/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

typical plot in finance: complies to tufte's idea of small multiples
nice seaborn plot that conveys a lot of info at once.


x, y labels should be spelled out, not a variable name with an underscore

labels too small

the fit line cannot be seen over the poitns. consider a different color or remove the points insice the contours (which are redundant and blended anyways)







NOTES ON YOUR PLOT THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


rbc299
============

the 2 points default in the legend should he substituted by a single plot as it is redundant and with large points it overlaps

missing units on x and y axis


the y tick labels should be in a more compressed readable notation, e.g. change units to millions


the empty space in the plot is distracting and does not help comparison (remember tufte's rules) 

the point size is unexplained

the color of Bk and Bx is indistinguishable at first sight

the legend shows "dot size reflects..." which belongs in a separate label, not in the legend, and it confuses the association of the blue color to SI.

size differential too large




tg1442
============

too many vivid colors are distracting

agegroup one word in the tiel

thousands is not ameaningful axis labels; use "Population (units of 1,000 peope")

and then why use units of 1000 when your first tick label is 1e5? then one has to think what 1e5*1000 is. use units of millions, and then your first tick is 100 etc


mu529
============
  
interesting plot: the choice of plotting with small points allows the structure in the data to be seen

robust to color blindness

the three default dots in the legend should be changed to 1 as they are redudnant
